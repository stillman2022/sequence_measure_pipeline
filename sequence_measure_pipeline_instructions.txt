Input: 

Takes in sequences and associated measure (example: genotype_file.csv)

Actions:

Determine loci location on sequence by sequence conservation.

Make a list of the unique alleles in those loci.

Output:

Creates regression that predicts the affect of alleles on associated measure.

Creates figure of regression (example: genotype_file.csv)

Creates table of which allele is located in which loci. (example: locus_allele_seq_key.csv)

Creates table of which allele is in which sequence. (example: data_dict.csv)

Creates figure of allele counts(example: ALLELE_COUNT.jpg)

Creates figure of allele counts(example: allele_count.csv)
